# Music-Controller-Web-App

Develop an Music-Controller-Web-App using gin and react.

## description

I found an interesting project ([video from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j)) on Youtube, which was implemented by Django and react, i happened to be learning golang recently, so I decided to use gin to refactor the project.

## start

I follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j) step by step to make this project, so if you are interested in my project and want to start developing some functions, it is very necessary for you to see that [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j).
